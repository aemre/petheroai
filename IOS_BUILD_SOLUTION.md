# Pet Hero AI - iOS Build Solution 🔧

## 🐛 Issue Identified:

The iOS native build is failing because of a package.json path error. This is a common issue when transitioning from managed to bare workflow.

## ✅ Working Solutions (Choose One):

### Solution 1: Expo Go (Works Right Now)
This is **immediately available** and working:

```bash
# Start the development server

# - Press 'g' to open in Expo Go
# - Scan QR code with Expo Go app
# - Press 'w' for web browser
```

**Status**: ✅ **Working perfectly** - Shows Pet Hero AI interface

### Solution 2: Clean Native Build (Recommended)
Fix the native build with proper setup:

```bash
# 1. Stop any running servers
# Kill Metro if running

# 2. Clean project completely
rm -rf ios android .expo node_modules/.cache

# 3. Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# 4. Create proper native build
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 5. Run iOS
npx expo run:ios
```

### Solution 3: EAS Development Build (Production-Ready)
Create a proper development build:

```bash
# 1. Install EAS CLI (if not installed)
npm install -g eas-cli

# 2. Login to Expo
eas login

# 3. Configure project for EAS
eas build:configure

# 4. Create development build
eas build --profile development --platform ios

# 5. Install on device/simulator and run
npx expo start --dev-client
```
