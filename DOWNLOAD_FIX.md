# Download Feature Fix

## Problem

Users were getting the error: `[Error: Asset couldn't be saved to photo library]` when clicking the download button.

## Root Cause

The `MediaLibrary.createAssetAsync()` function in React Native/Expo expects a **local file path**, but we were passing it a **remote URL** from Firebase Storage. This is a common mistake that causes the "Asset couldn't be saved" error.

## Solution

### Before (Broken):

```javascript
// ‚ùå This fails because resultUrl is a remote URL
const asset = await MediaLibrary.createAssetAsync(currentPhoto.resultUrl);
```

### After (Fixed):

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Download remote image to local storage first
const response = await fetch(currentPhoto.resultUrl);
const blob = await response.blob();

// Convert to base64
const base64Data = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  reader.onloadend = () => resolve(reader.result.split(",")[1]);
  reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
});

// Save to local temporary file
const tempPath = `${FileSystem.documentDirectory}hero_${Date.now()}.jpg`;
await FileSystem.writeAsStringAsync(tempPath, base64Data, {
  encoding: FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64,
});

// Now create asset from local file
const asset = await MediaLibrary.createAssetAsync(tempPath);
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Download Function** (`handleDownload`)

- Downloads image from Firebase Storage URL
- Converts to base64 format
- Saves to local temporary file
- Creates photo library asset from local file
- Adds to "Pet Hero AI" album (creates if doesn't exist)
- Cleans up temporary file after saving

### 2. **Share Function** (`handleShare`)

- Same download approach for consistency
- Creates temporary file for sharing
- Uses local file path for sharing
- Automatic cleanup after 5 seconds

### 3. **Error Handling**

- Graceful fallback if album creation fails
- Detailed logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Download**: Works with any image URL (Firebase Storage, generated images, etc.)
2. **Album Organization**: Creates "Pet Hero AI" album in photo library
3. **Better Sharing**: Share function also uses local files for better compatibility
4. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of temporary files
5. **Error Recovery**: Continues even if album operations fail

## Testing

‚úÖ **Download Feature**:

- Click download button
- Should see "Hero image saved to your gallery! ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
- Check Photos app for image in "Pet Hero AI" album

‚úÖ **Share Feature**:

- Click share button
- Should open system share dialog
- Image should share successfully

## Technical Details

- Uses `expo-file-system` for local file operations
- Downloads via `fetch()` API for cross-platform compatibility
- Base64 encoding for reliable file writing
- Proper MIME type handling (`image/jpeg`)
- Temporary file cleanup prevents storage bloat

This fix ensures reliable image saving and sharing across iOS and Android devices.
