# Rate Limiting Solution for Gemini API

## Problem

The Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview model has strict rate limits on the free tier:

- Limited input tokens per minute
- Limited requests per minute
- Limited requests per day

When these limits are exceeded, you get a 429 "Too Many Requests" error.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. **Multi-Model Fallback Strategy**

- **Primary**: `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` (with image analysis)
- **Fallback**: `gemini-1.5-flash` (text-only, more generous limits)

### 2. **Intelligent Error Handling**

- Detects rate limit errors (429, quota, RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED)
- Automatically falls back to simpler models
- Continues processing instead of failing completely

### 3. **Retry Logic with Backoff**

- Waits 20 seconds before final retry
- Uses simpler prompts for retries
- Graceful degradation to creative placeholders

### 4. **Creative Placeholder System**

- Pre-written creative descriptions for each hero theme
- Ensures users always get a result
- Maintains app functionality even during API outages

## How It Works

```
Upload Image → Try Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
    ↓ (if rate limited)
Try Gemini 1.5 Flash (text-only)
    ↓ (if still rate limited)
Wait 20 seconds → Retry with simple prompt
    ↓ (if still failing)
Use Creative Placeholder → Success!
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilient**: App never completely fails due to API limits
2. **Cost-Effective**: Falls back to cheaper models automatically
3. **User Experience**: Users always get results, even if simplified
4. **Scalable**: Handles high traffic gracefully

## Rate Limit Recovery

- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**: Limits reset every minute/day
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash**: More generous limits
- **Placeholders**: Unlimited and instant

## Testing

With your current test mode enabled, you can upload multiple images to test the rate limiting behavior. The system will:

1. Try the advanced image model first
2. Fall back gracefully when limits are hit
3. Provide creative descriptions that match the hero themes
4. Continue working reliably

## Future Improvements

1. **Caching**: Store analysis results to reduce API calls
2. **Queue System**: Delay processing during peak usage
3. **Premium Tier**: Use paid API limits for better reliability
4. **User Feedback**: Show different UI for fallback modes
