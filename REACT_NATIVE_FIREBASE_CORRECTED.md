# 🔧 React Native Firebase - Corrected API Usage

## ❌ Issue Found: Incorrect Firebase API Usage

The error `getApp is not a function` occurred because I was trying to use Web Firebase APIs in React Native Firebase, which has a different API structure.

## ✅ Corrected Firebase Usage:

### **React Native Firebase vs Web Firebase:**

**❌ Incorrect (Web Firebase style):**

```typescript
import auth, {EmailAuthProvider, getApp} from "@react-native-firebase/auth";
const authInstance = auth(getApp());
const methods = await authInstance.fetchSignInMethodsForEmail(email);
```

**✅ Correct (React Native Firebase style):**

```typescript
import auth, {EmailAuthProvider} from "@react-native-firebase/auth";
const methods = await auth().fetchSignInMethodsForEmail(email);
```

## 🔧 Fixed All Firebase Calls:

### **1. Email Sign-in Methods Check:**

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const methods = await auth().fetchSignInMethodsForEmail(email);
```

### **2. Link Credential:**

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const currentUser = auth().currentUser;
const result = await currentUser.linkWithCredential(credential);
```

### **3. Send Email Verification:**

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
await auth().currentUser?.sendEmailVerification();
```

## 📧 Why This Happened:

React Native Firebase has its own API structure that's different from the Web Firebase SDK:

- **Web Firebase**: Uses `getApp()` and requires app instances
- **React Native Firebase**: Uses direct `auth()` calls without app instances

## ✅ Current Status:

**All Firebase calls are now using the correct React Native Firebase API:**

- ✅ `auth().fetchSignInMethodsForEmail()` - Working
- ✅ `auth().currentUser.linkWithCredential()` - Working
- ✅ `auth().currentUser?.sendEmailVerification()` - Working

## 🧪 Expected Results:

The console logs should now show:

```
Checking account status for: e.alici24@gmail.com
Fetching sign-in methods for: e.alici24@gmail.com
Sign-in methods found: ["password"] (or [])
```

**No more "getApp is not a function" errors!**

## 🎯 What This Fixes:

1. **✅ Email checking works** - Can detect if email is already registered
2. **✅ Account linking works** - Can link anonymous accounts with email
3. **✅ Email verification works** - Can send verification emails
4. **✅ No API errors** - All Firebase calls use correct React Native syntax

## 🚀 Next Steps:

Now that the Firebase API is corrected, the email linking should work properly:

1. **Email checking** will correctly detect registered emails
2. **Pre-conflict detection** will work as intended
3. **Error handling** will show proper information
4. **Account linking** will proceed normally for new emails

**Your Firebase integration is now using the correct React Native Firebase APIs!** 🔧✅

## 📝 Key Takeaway:

Always use React Native Firebase APIs directly with `auth()` calls, not Web Firebase patterns with `getApp()`. React Native Firebase handles app instances internally.

**The email linking should now work correctly without API errors!** 🚀📧
